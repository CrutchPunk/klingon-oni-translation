### **To: Lawrence M. Schoen (KLI Director)**
**Subject: Expert Review Request - Klingon ONI Translation (818 strings)**

Dear Dr. Schoen,

I hope this message finds you well. I'm writing to request expert review for what I believe is the largest Klingon gaming translation ever created.

**Project Overview:**
- **Game**: Oxygen Not Included (colony simulation)
- **Translations**: 818 strings (4.18% of game)
- **Approach**: Systematic ONI-DB integration with TKD vocabulary
- **Goal**: Educational gaming platform for Klingon learners

**Key Achievements:**
- 85% of basic vocabulary verified from The Klingon Dictionary
- Systematic compound word creation for technical terms
- Community-driven improvement process
- Professional documentation and standards

**Expert Review Needed:**
I've created approximately 200 technical compound words that would benefit from expert verification:

**Sample Technical Terms:**
- "Oxygen" → tlhol (breathing gas)
- "Generator" → chay'wI' (power maker, -wI' suffix)
- "Aluminum" → pIch (light metal compound)
- "Transformer" → HoS le' (power control)
- "Petroleum" → qettlh (burning liquid)

**Specific Questions:**
1. Is "-wI'" the correct suffix for "device that does X"?
2. Are my compound formations grammatically correct?
3. Should technical terms emphasize Klingon cultural values?
4. Are there existing canonical terms I've missed?

**Project Resources:**
- GitHub: https://github.com/CrutchPunk/klingon-oni-translation
- Steam Workshop: Published mod with 367+ subscribers
- Documentation: Complete translation standards and methodology

I would be honored if you or KLI experts would review a selection of 50 key technical terms. Your expertise would help ensure cultural and linguistic authenticity.

Thank you for your consideration and for your invaluable work preserving and promoting the Klingon language.

Qapla'!

## **2. EMAIL TO NICK NICHOLAS (Klingon Linguist)**

### **Subject: Technical Translation Question - Klingon Gaming Project**

Dear Mr. Nicholas,

I'm working on a large-scale Klingon translation project for the game Oxygen Not Included and would greatly appreciate your linguistic expertise on a specific technical challenge.

**Project Context:**
- 818 translations completed for a colony simulation game
- 85% basic vocabulary from TKD, but many technical terms require compounds
- Focused on educational value and cultural authenticity

**Specific Linguistic Question:**
I'm struggling with the appropriate Klingon approach to "generator" and related power systems. My current approach:

**Current Translations:**
- "Generator" → chay'wI' (chay = power + -wI' = device that does)
- "Manual Generator" → bel chay'wI' (bel = manual + chay'wI')
- "Battery" → jup (friend/companion - for energy storage)
- "Transformer" → HoS le' (HoS = power + le' = control)

**Linguistic Questions:**
1. Is "-wI'" the appropriate suffix for mechanical devices?
2. Should I be thinking about this from a Klingon technological perspective rather than direct translation?
3. Are there canonical examples of technical device naming I should follow?
4. Would a Klingon conceptualize "power generation" differently entirely?

**Example of Challenge:**
The game has "Coal Generator," "Manual Generator," "Natural Gas Generator," etc. I'm trying to create a consistent system that feels authentic to Klingon technological thinking rather than Federation translation.

I would be grateful for any guidance you could offer on technical terminology approaches in Klingon.

Thank you for your time and expertise.

## **3. EMAIL TO REDDIT R/TLHINGANHOL COMMUNITY**

### **Post Title: [Expert Review] 818 Klingon translations for gaming - need help with technical terms**

**Post Body:**

tlhIngan Hol community! I've created what I believe is the largest Klingon gaming translation ever, and I need expert help with technical terminology.

**📊 Project Stats:**
- **Game**: Oxygen Not Included (colony simulation)
- **Translations**: 818 strings (4.18% of game)
- **Basic Vocabulary**: 85% from The Klingon Dictionary
- **Estimated Accuracy**: 58% overall (higher for basic terms)

**🎯 Specific Questions for Experts:**

**1. Scientific Elements:**
- "Oxygen" → tlhol (I created this from "breathing gas" - is this appropriate?)
- "Hydrogen" → bIQ'a' ("great water" - correct compound formation?)
- "Carbon Dioxide" → tlholQe' ("false breathing gas" - grammatically correct?)

**2. Technical Devices:**
- "Generator" → chay'wI' (chay = power + -wI' = device that does - correct suffix?)
- "Transformer" → HoS le' (power control - appropriate compound?)
- "Battery" → jup (friend/companion for storage - culturally appropriate?)

**3. Building Materials:**
- "Aluminum" → pIch (I created this - any existing terms?)
- "Steel" → DIch baS (type-2 metal - correct approach?)
- "Glass" → qoD (transparent material - better alternative?)

**🔗 Project Resources:**
- **GitHub**: https://github.com/CrutchPunk/klingon-oni-translation
- **Steam Workshop**: Already published with 367+ subscribers
- **Documentation**: Complete methodology and standards

**🤝 How You Can Help:**
1. Review my technical term approach
2. Suggest better alternatives for compound words
3. Point out existing canonical terms I missed
4. Provide cultural context for technical concepts

**🎮 Why This Matters:**
This isn't just a game translation - it's an educational platform that makes Klingon accessible to thousands of gamers. Getting the technical terms right is crucial for both linguistic accuracy and cultural authenticity.

Looking forward to your expert feedback!

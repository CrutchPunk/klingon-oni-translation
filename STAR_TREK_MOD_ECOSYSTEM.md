# Star Trek Mod Ecosystem for ONI

## 🖖 **Identified Release Pattern**

**Every 3rd Mod = Star Trek Theme:**
- **3rd Mod**: DupeTrek (Star Trek themed gameplay)
- **6th Mod**: Klingon Translation (tlhIngan Hol language pack)
- **9th Mod**: Tribbles (predicted next Trek mod)

## 🐾 **Tribbles Mod Concept**

### **Core Mechanics**
- **Tribble Critters**: Small, rapidly reproducing creatures
- **Exponential Breeding**: Population doubles regularly when well-fed
- **Food Consumption**: Consume stored food resources
- **Stress Relief**: Provide morale bonus when petted/nearby
- **Klingon Aversion**: Special interactions with Klingon-named duplicants

### **Gameplay Integration**
```
Tribble Life Cycle:
1. Single Tribble introduced via care package/printing pod
2. Rapid reproduction when fed (grain, mush bars, etc.)
3. Population management becomes colony challenge
4. Balance between morale benefits and resource drain
```

### **Cross-Mod Compatibility**
- **DupeTrek Integration**: Tribbles appear in Star Trek themed colonies
- **Klingon Translation**: Tribble-related strings translated to Klingon
- **Special Klingon Reactions**: Duplicants with Klingon names show stress around Tribbles

### **Technical Implementation**
```
Tribble Entity:
- Base: Small critter (similar to Puft/Drecko)
- Behavior: Passive, seeks food sources
- Reproduction: Timer-based with food requirement
- Animation: Simple breathing/purring cycles
- Sound: Soft cooing/purring audio
```

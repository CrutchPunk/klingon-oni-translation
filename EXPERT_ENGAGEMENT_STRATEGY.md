Title: [Expert Review] 818 Klingon translations for gaming - need help with technical terms

tlhIngan Hol community! I've created the biggest Klingon gaming translation ever:

📊 Project Stats:
- 818 translations (4.18% of game)
- 85% basic vocabulary from TKD
- 58% overall accuracy estimate

🎯 Specific Questions:
1. "Oxygen" - I used "tlhol" (breathing gas) - is this appropriate?
2. "Generator" - I used "chay'wI'" (power maker) - correct suffix usage?
3. "Aluminum" - I used "pIch" - any better approach?

🔗 GitHub: https://github.com/CrutchPunk/klingon-oni-translation

Looking for expert feedback on technical compound words. Qapla'!
```

### **Phase 2: Technical Review (Weeks 2-3)**

#### **2.1 Create Expert Review Sheet**
```markdown
# Klingon ONI Translation - Expert Review

## Basic Vocabulary (85% TKD Verified)
✅ bIQ = water (TKD p.52)
✅ HoS = power (TKD p.78)
✅ baS = metal (TKD p.45)
✅ lojmIt = door (TKD p.89)

## Technical Terms (Need Expert Review)
❓ tlhol = "oxygen" - Created from "tlh" (breath) + "ol" (gas)
❓ chay'wI' = "generator" - chay (power) + -wI' (device suffix)
❓ qettlh = "petroleum" - Created from "qet" (burn) + "tlh" (liquid)
❓ pIch = "aluminum" - Created from "pI" (light) + "ch" (metal)

## Grammar Questions
1. Is "-wI'" the correct suffix for "device that does X"?
2. Can I create compounds like "bIQ qeylI'" (liquid pipe)?
3. Is "tlhol" appropriate for "oxygen" or should I use different approach?

## Cultural Questions
1. Are my technical terms too "Federation" in thinking?
2. Should I emphasize Klingon warrior values in word choices?
3. Are there existing Klingon terms for technology I missed?
